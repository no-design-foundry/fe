This filter is implementation of the idea by [Thom Janssen](https://hallotype.github.io). Angle, Step, Thickness, and Flipped End, along with a toggle option to display a 'shadow' effect reminiscent of Peter Pan's shadow. Due to performance considerations, some of Thom's original ideas were not fully implemented.
