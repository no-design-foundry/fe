This is the type foundry without any typefaces. It contains collection of filters that can be applied on already existing fonts, the ones you already have. It tries to reuse and refresh already existing fonts and designs.

This website doesn't store your fonts, your fonts are only processed on the server and sent to you directly.

This project is primarily work of [Jan Šindler](https://www.jansindler.com), but also of many others who directly or indirectly influenced this project. Thank you: [Thom Janssen](https://www.hallotype.nl/), Just van Rossum & everyone at [TM](https://typemedia.org/) & everyone who keeps maintained all the libraries that I am using in this project.

This website doesn't store any fonts, make sure you font license is compliant with usage of this website.
