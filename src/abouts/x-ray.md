Bézier curves can be notoriously tricky—sometimes they just don’t cooperate, leaving us frustrated. But despite their quirks, we can’t help but love them! Now, there’s a new way to showcase your Bézier to your parents and best friends – as a color variable font!

This approach lets you present your curves to anyone you dare to impress! Want to catch the eye of that fancy person in the front row? Go for thin, elegant lines. Is your grandmother having trouble seeing the details? No problem—just increase the thickness of the outline! No matter what, Xray has you covered!

Ready for the game changer in the B-B-Béziers presentating play?

This project is inspired by the work of David Jonathan Ross and his font Gimlet X-Ray https://djr.com/gimlet-xray
